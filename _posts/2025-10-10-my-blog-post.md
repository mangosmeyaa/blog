#  Finding My Place: What My Summer Job at St. Nicks Alliance Taught Me. (in all brutal honesty)

<span style="color: #32CD32;">  On the first day of my summer job with St. Nicks Alliance, I was completely lost. I didn’t know anyone, and stepping into a new environment felt like diving into the unknown. I arrived on time, ready for what I thought would be a janitorial position, but that assumption was quickly proven wrong. Instead, I was told I’d be working with kids. That instantly brought a smile to my face until I learned they were 7th and 8th graders. I expected chaos, but what I found instead were some of the kindest and funniest kids I’ve ever met.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">Even though I was there to stay professional, I couldn’t help laughing at their inside jokes like “67,” “this game steals a brainrot,” and “skibidi toilet.” Those moments reminded me to appreciate small joys and value the time you have before it’s gone. When the job ended, I missed them more than I expected.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">I also met some amazing coworkers. One thing about me is that I’ll start a conversation with anyone, even on day one, and that helped me build quick connections. From spontaneous TikToks to daily laughter, we created memories that made the job even better.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">My supervisor wasn’t exactly my favorite person, but in hindsight, she taught me something important: punctuality matters, and excuses don’t get you paid. She also had this uncanny ability to tell when I wasn’t being completely honest, which pushed me to be more straightforward.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">By the end of the summer, I realized that this experience wasn’t just about work. It was about growth. I learned how to adapt, connect with people, and find meaning even in unexpected roles.</span>

# The Beach Trip That Changed Me (I will never be the same)**

<span style="color: #32CD32;">I spent the day with Kael, Leah, and a friend from my homeschool, and we went to Far Rockaway Beach. Planning this trip wasn’t easy. I had to keep rescheduling because of bad weather or because I just wasn’t mentally ready to go. I get really self-conscious, and it’s something I’ve struggled with for a while. But my friends convinced me every step of the way. They reminded me that I didn’t need to look a certain way, and eventually, I told myself, “You know what, I’ll go.”</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">When we finally got to the beach, everyone contributed. Leah brought blankets, Kael brought snacks, a speaker, and a cooler, and I brought towels. It felt good to see how everything came together. We all went into the water, and I was having so much fun. I fell a lot, but every time I did, someone reached out to help me back up. That moment reminded me how supported I truly was.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">I also want to thank Kael. We had known each other since junior year. Without realizing it, I picked him as my partner in Mr. Forlenza’s class, and that small moment started one of the most meaningful friendships I’ve ever had. We talked almost every day, shared laughs, and helped each other through everything. But eventually, we decided to go our separate ways. It broke my heart, and I’ll never forget that day—October 16, 2025. That date will always stay with me because it marked a turning point. I made a selfish decision, and it’s something I carry with me as I move through my senior year.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">During the end of junior year, I started to lose motivation. Things felt heavy. But Kael showed me how to take things one day at a time. He believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. Losing someone who meant that much made me reflect deeply. Kael helped me realize I needed therapy, and taking that step changed my life. It wasn’t about sadness—it was about growth.</span>

<span style="color: #32CD32;">Now, whenever I struggle, I think about Kael. I remind myself of the strength and patience he taught me. He continues to motivate me, even from a distance, to work harder on my assignments and on myself. That beach trip wasn’t just a day in the sun—it was the start of me finding my way back to who I am.</span>

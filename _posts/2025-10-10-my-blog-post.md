Finding My Place: What My Summer Job at St. Nicks Alliance Taught Me. (in all brutal honesty)

<span style="color: green;"> On the first day of my summer job with St. Nicks Alliance, I was completely lost. I didn’t know anyone, and stepping into a new environment felt like diving into the unknown. I arrived on time, ready for what I thought would be a janitorial position, but that assumption was quickly proven wrong. Instead, I was told I’d be working with kids. That instantly brought a smile to my face until I learned they were 7th and 8th graders. I expected chaos, but what I found instead were some of the kindest and funniest kids I’ve ever met.</span>

<span style="color: green;">Even though I was there to stay professional, I couldn’t help laughing at their inside jokes like “67,” “this game steals a brainrot,” and “skibidi toilet.” Those moments reminded me to appreciate small joys and value the time you have before it’s gone. When the job ended, I missed them more than I expected.</span>

<span style="color: green;">I also met some amazing coworkers. One thing about me is that I’ll start a conversation with anyone, even on day one, and that helped me build quick connections. From spontaneous TikToks to daily laughter, we created memories that made the job even better.</span>

<span style="color: green;">My supervisor wasn’t exactly my favorite person, but in hindsight, she taught me something important: punctuality matters, and excuses don’t get you paid. She also had this uncanny ability to tell when I wasn’t being completely honest, which pushed me to be more straightforward.</span>

<span style="color: green;">By the end of the summer, I realized that this experience wasn’t just about work. It was about growth. I learned how to adapt, connect with people, and find meaning even in unexpected roles.</span>
